# Air_painter_by_finger

 Draw with Your Fingers in the Air!

No mouse, no touchscreen — just your index finger and a webcam!
I built an AI-powered Air Painter Application using MediaPipe + OpenCV that lets you paint, erase, and create digital art in real time with simple hand gestures.

 What it Does:

Detects your hand using MediaPipe Hands

Draws in real-time when the index finger is raised

Supports 8 color palettes (or rainbow mode)

 Neon Glow Effect for stylish strokes

 Eraser mode with adjustable size

 Undo feature for corrections

 Save your artwork as PNG with one key

On-screen HUD with controls for easy navigation

 Built With: Python | OpenCV | MediaPipe | NumPy | Computer Vision

 Demo video included to showcase how you can literally paint in the air using just your hands!

 This project taught me how gesture recognition can transform human–computer interaction into something intuitive and fun. Imagine extending this concept into AR, VR, or AI-powered design too
